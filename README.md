Klautor
=======

Klautor was a school project from 2004. It's a simple HTTP-based Java-program for mobile devices (midlet) that is useful for pupils or students to keep track of dates of examinations and tests. The sourcecode was released under GPL and is stored at this place for people who are still interested in this old stuff.

Information about Klautor and how to use it you can find at <http://klautor.brakensiek.info>.
